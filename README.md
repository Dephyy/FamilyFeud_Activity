# Family Feud Activity

## Overview
This project is a web-based Family Feud game that allows players to compete in a fun, interactive trivia-style game. The system utilizes HTML for structure, CSS and Bootstrap for styling, JavaScript for game logic, and PHP with MySQL for server-side data management.

## HTML
HTML structured the gameâ€™s content, organizing elements like questions, input fields, and scoreboards, using semantic tags to enhance readability and maintainability. 

## CSS & Bootstrap
CSS and Bootstrap were applied to style the game, ensuring responsiveness through Bootstrap's grid system while customizing elements like buttons and tables for a cohesive design.

## JavaScript
JavaScript handled game logic, managing actions such as scoring, round transitions, and communicating with the PHP backend.

## PHP & MySQL
PHP was used for server-side operations, managing player data and saving scores to a MySQL database.
